### Course Overview

###### Entry requirements
Open for master students in Linguistics and Communication, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Cognitive Neuroscience.

###### Aims
This course introduces students to the field of interactive language technology, provides hands-on experience working with speech technologies, and equips students to build and assess interactive interfaces. Looking under the bonnet of current ‘social’ technologies, the course aims to foster a deeper understanding of how these interfaces work and what their limits are, and to enable students to participate in ongoing discourse about risks and uses in academic research and society at large. Upon completion of the course, students are familiar with the main ingredients that make or break conversational interfaces.

###### Content
This course introduces current language and communication technologies, covering a wide range of “AI”-powered technologies including text generators (e.g. ChatGPT), dialogue systems, and social robotics, broadly covered under the nomer “Conversational AI”. Starting from human interaction as the primary ecology of language, we look at how interactive interfaces exploit linguistic structures, interactional infrastructure and ways of sense-making that people bring to interactive language use. Students will learn the basics of interactive language modelling and explore the scientific and theoretical foundations of understanding structure and variation in conversational speech. Aspects of conversational infrastructure covered include turn-taking, interactive repair, and action ascription. The course also touches upon societal and ethical issues that emerge alongside the rise of conversational interfaces. A unique aspect of this course is the hands-on group work on cutting-edge social robots and large language models. This provides students with relevant expertise in the engineering, design and evaluation of conversational AI. This course might appeal to anyone interested in recent approaches to conversational AI and understanding why talking machines still struggle to hold up their end of a conversation.
